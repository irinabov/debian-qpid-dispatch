# reconfigure.in is a workaround to force cmake re-configuration. For example,
# we use GLOB to collect .h files for install and apidoc, so if you _remove_ a
# .h file it won't trigger automatic re-configure and everybody's builds will
# fail till they run cmake manually.
#
# If you do check in such a change, increase the number in this file by 1.
# That will force automatic re-configure and everybody will be happy.
