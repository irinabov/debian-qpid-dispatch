# API documentation

`api`: User API documentation is generated automatically from [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org)
comments in public header files.  You can use the `@internal` tag to mark items
that should be hidden in the user API docs.

`api_dev` includes everything in `api`, plus anything marked `@internal`, plus
doc comments from private headers and implementation files in the `src`
directory. It is a cheap-and-cheerful code-browser for developers.

Please include doc comments for everything in public header files. Use your
discretion as to when it is useful in private implementation files.
