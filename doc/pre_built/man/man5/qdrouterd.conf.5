.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
qdroutered.conf is the configuration file for the dispatch router.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The configuration file is made up of sections with this syntax:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
SECTION\-NAME {
    ATTRIBUTE\-NAME: ATTRIBUTE\-VALUE
    ATTRIBUTE\-NAME: ATTRIBUTE\-VALUE
    ...
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are two types of sections:
.sp
\fIConfiguration sections\fP correspond to configuration entities. They can be queried and
configured via management tools as well as via the configuration file.
.sp
\fIAnnotation sections\fP define a group of attribute values that can be included in
one or more entity sections.
.sp
For example you can define an "ssl\-profile" annotation section with SSL credentials
that can be included in multiple "listener" entities. Here\(aqs an example, note
how the \(aqssl\-profile\(aq attribute of \(aqlistener\(aq sections references the \(aqname\(aq
attribute of \(aqssl\-profile\(aq sections.

.TP
.B \fIbias\fP (One of [\(aqclosest\(aq, \(aqspread\(aq], default=\(aqclosest\(aq)
