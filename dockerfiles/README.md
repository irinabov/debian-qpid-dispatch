####Docker 
Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software
containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level
virtualization on Linux.
<https://www.docker.com/what-docker>

####Dockerfiles for Fedora, Ubuntu and Centos
The docker files, Dockerfile-fedora, Dockerfile-ubuntu, and Dockerfile-centos provide quick start
docker containers with a running instance of qpid dispatch router on the various platforms.

The dockerfiles follow these steps before launching the dispatch router

* Downloads all the specific dependencies needed for building apache qpid-proton.
* Downloads the source code of qpid-proton to /main/qpid-proton
* Builds and installs qpid-proton using gcc. 
* Downloads the source code of qpid-dispatch to /main/qpid-dispatch.
* Builds and installs qpid-dispatch using gcc.  
* Launches qpid-dispatch router

####Building and running Dockerfiles
* To build the fedora docker file
 * sudo docker build -t docker-image-name --file=Dockerfile-fedora  .  (substitute docker-image-name with your own image name)
* To build the ubuntu docker file
 * sudo docker build -t docker-image-name --file=Dockerfile-ubuntu  .  (substitute docker-image-name with your own image name)
* To build the centos docker file
 * sudo docker build -t docker-image-name --file=Dockerfile-centos  .  (substitute docker-image-name with your own image name)

* To run the fedora/ubuntu/centos docker image
 * sudo docker run -i -t docker-image-name (substitute docker-image-name with your own image name)
* After the docker run command is invoked, execute the *sudo docker ps* command to check if your container name shows up in the list of docker processes.

####Running unit tests
Uncomment the line *RUN ctest -VV*  to run the dispatch unit and system tests.

####Getting core dumps and backtraces from qdrouterd crashes and asserts

* Install gdb. Add another step to the Docker build file and rebuild.

    RUN dnf -y install gdb

* Run the docker image shell prompt in a container with extended privileges

    sudo docker run --privileged -i -t docker-image-name /bin/bash

* At the container shell prompt enable crash dumps (as appropriate for your container host)

    $ ulimit -c unlimited
    
    $ echo "coredump.%e.%p" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

* From the build directory run ctest

    $ ctest -VV -R some_test

* From the build directory examine core file in test setUpClass directory of the failed router. The core file is in the same directory as the router log file. The example shown here is for a policy oversize basic test failure while using the MaxMessageSizeBlockOversize class.

    $ gdb router/qdrouterd ./tests/system_test.dir/system_tests_policy_oversize_basic/MaxMessageSizeBlockOversize/setUpClass/coredump.nnn.mmm
    
    (gdb) bt

####Note
These dockerfiles are provided for developers to quickly get started with the dispatch router and are not intended for use in production environments.
