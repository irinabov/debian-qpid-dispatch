= Setting up access to {ConsoleName}

Before you can access the web console, you must configure a `listener` to accept HTTP connections for the web console and serve the console files.

.Procedure

. On the router from which you want to access the web console, open the `{RouterConfigFile}` configuration file.

. Add a `listener` to serve the console.
+
--
This example creates a `listener` that clients can use to access the web console:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 8672
    role: normal
    http: true
    httpRootDir: /usr/share/qpid-dispatch/console
}
----
`host`:: The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or hostname on which the router will listen.

`port`:: The port number or symbolic service name on which the router will listen.

`role`:: The role of the connection. Specify `normal` to indicate that this connection is used for client traffic.

`http`:: Set this attribute to `true` to specify that this `listener` should accept HTTP connections instead of plain AMQP connections.

`httpRootDir`:: Specify the absolute path to the directory that contains the web console HTML files. The default directory is the stand-alone console installation directory, usually `/usr/share/qpid-dispatch/console`.
--

. If you want to secure access to the console, secure the `listener`.

For more information, see xref:securing-incoming-client-connections-{context}[]. This example adds basic user name and password authentication using SASL PLAIN:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 8672
    role: normal
    http: true
    httpRootDir: /usr/share/qpid-dispatch/console
    authenticatePeer: yes
    saslMechanisms: PLAIN
}
----

. If you want to set up access to the web console from any other router in the router network, repeat this procedure for each router.
