= How policies enforce connection and resource limits

{RouterName} uses policies to determine whether to permit a connection, and if it is permitted, to apply the appropriate resource limits.

When a client creates a connection to a router, the router first determines whether to allow or deny the connection. This decision is based on the following criteria:

* Whether the connection will exceed the router’s global connection limit (defined in the global policy)

* Whether the connection will exceed the vhost’s connection limits (defined in the vhost policy that matches the host to which the connection is directed)

If the connection is allowed, the router assigns the user (the authenticated user name from the connection) to a user group, and enforces the user group’s resource limits for the lifetime of the connection.
