= Overview of AMQP

{RouterName} implements version 1.0 of the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) specification. Therefore, you should understand several key AMQP terms and concepts before deploying or configuring {RouterName}.

Containers::
AMQP is a wire-level messaging protocol for transferring messages between applications called _containers_. In AMQP, a container is any application that sends or receives messages, such as a client application or message broker.
+
Containers connect to each other over _connections_, which are channels for communication.

Nodes::
Containers contain addressable entities called _nodes_ that are responsible for storing or delivering messages. For example, a queue on a message broker is a node. 

Links::
Messages are transferred between connected containers over _links_. A link is a unidirectional route between nodes. Essentially, a link is a channel for sending or receiving messages.
+
Links are established over _sesssions_, which are contexts for sending and receiving messages. Sessions are established over connections.
