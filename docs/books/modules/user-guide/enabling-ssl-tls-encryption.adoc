[id='enabling-ssl-tls-encryption-{context}']
= Enabling SSL/TLS encryption

You can use SSL/TLS to encrypt an incoming connection from a client.

.Prerequisites

* An X.509 Certificate Authority (CA) must exist for the client connections.

* A security certificate must be generated and signed by the CA.

.Procedure

include::{FragmentDir}/fragment-router-open-config-file-step.adoc[]

. If the router does not contain an `sslProfile` that defines the private keys and certificates for client connections, then add one.
+
--
This `sslProfile` contains the locations of the private key and certificates that the router should use to encrypt connections from clients.

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
sslProfile {
    name: service-tls
    certFile: /etc/pki/tls/certs/tls.crt
    caCertFile: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
    privateKeyFile: /etc/pki/tls/private/tls.key
    password: file:/etc/pki/tls/private/password.txt
    ...
}
----
`name`:: A unique name that you can use to refer to this `sslProfile`.

`certFile`:: The absolute path to the file containing the public certificate for this router.

`caCertFile`:: The absolute path to the CA certificate that was used to sign the router's certificate.

`privateKeyFile`:: The absolute path to the file containing the private key for this router's public certificate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the `qdrouterd` or root user can access the private key. For example:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
chmod 0600 /etc/pki/tls/private/tls.key
chown qdrouterd /etc/pki/tls/private/tls.key
----
====

//`password`
include::{FragmentDir}/fragment-password-description.adoc[]
--

. Configure the `listener` for this connection to use SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection.
+
--
This example configures a `normal` listener to encrypt connections from clients.

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 5672
    role: normal
    sslProfile: inter_router_tls
    requireSsl: yes
    ...
}
----
`sslProfile`:: The name of the `sslProfile` that defines the SSL/TLS private keys and certificates for client connections.

`requireSsl`:: Specify `true` to encrypt the connection with SSL/TLS.
