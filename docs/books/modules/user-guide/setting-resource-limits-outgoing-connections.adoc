= Setting resource limits for outgoing connections

If a router establishes an outgoing connection to an external AMQP container (such as a client or broker), you can restrict the resources that the external container can access on the router by configuring a connector vhost policy.

The resource limits that are defined in a connector vhost policy are applied to links that are initiated by the external AMQP container. The connector vhost policy does not restrict links that the router creates.

A connector vhost policy can only be applied to a connector with a `normal` or `route-container` role. You cannot apply connector vhost policies to connectors that have `inter-router` or `edge` roles.

.Prerequisites

* Vhost policies are enabled for the router. For more information, see xref:enabling-vhost-policies-{context}[].

.Procedure

. In the `{RouterConfigFile}` configuration file, add a `vhost` section with a `$connector` user group.

vhost {
    hostname: my-connector-policy
    groups: {
        $connector: {
            sources: *
            targets: *
            maxSenders: 5
            maxReceivers: 10
            allowAnonymousSender: true
            allowWaypointLinks: true
        }
    }
}
----

`hostname`::
A unique name to identify the connector vhost policy. This name does not represent an actual hostname; therefore, choose a name that will not conflict with an actual vhost hostname.

`$connector`::
Identifies this vhost policy as a connector vhost policy. For more information about the resource limits you can apply, see xref:creating-vhost-policies-{context}[].
--

. Apply the connector vhost policy to the connector that establishes the connection to the external AMQP container.

The following example applies the connector vhost policy that was configured in the previous step:

[options="nowrap"]
----
connector {
    host: 192.0.2.10
    port: 5672
    role: normal
    policyVhost: my-connector-policy
}
