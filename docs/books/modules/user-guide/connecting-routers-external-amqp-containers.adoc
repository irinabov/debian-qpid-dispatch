= Connecting to external AMQP containers

To enable a router to establish a connection to an external AMQP container (such as a message broker), you configure a `connector`.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of configuring a `connector` to initiate connections to the AMQP container, you can configure a `listener` to listen for connections from the AMQP container. However, in this case, the addresses on the AMQP container are available for routing only after the AMQP container has created a connection.

. Configure a `connector` with the `route-container` role.
+
--
This example creates a `connector` that initiates connections to a broker. The addresses on the broker will be available for routing once the router creates the connection and it is accepted by the broker.

connector {
    name: my-broker
    host: 192.0.2.10
    port: 5672
    role: route-container
    ...
}
----
`name`:: The name of the `connector`. Specify a name that describes the entity to which the router will connect.
`host`:: The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or hostname to which the router will connect.
`port`:: The port number or symbolic service name to which the router will connect.
`role`:: The role of the connection. Specify `route-container` to indicate that this connection is for an AMQP container that holds known addresses.
