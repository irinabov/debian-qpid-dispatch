= Connecting using mutual SSL/TLS authentication

You can connect to an external AMQP container (such as a broker) using mutual SSL/TLS authentication. With this method, the router, acting as a client, provides a certificate to the external AMQP container so that it can verify the router's identity.

.Prerequisites

* An X.509 Certificate Authority (CA) must exist for the router.

* A security certificate must be generated for the router and be signed by the CA.

.Procedure

include::{FragmentDir}/fragment-router-open-config-file-step.adoc[]

. If the router does not contain an `sslProfile` that defines the private keys and certificates to connect to the external AMQP container, then add one.
+
--
This `sslProfile` contains the locations of the private key and certificates that the router should use to authenticate with its peer.

----
sslProfile {
    name: broker-tls
    certFile: /etc/pki/tls/certs/tls.crt
    caCertFile: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
    privateKeyFile: /etc/pki/tls/private/tls.key
    password: file:/etc/pki/tls/private/password.txt
    ...
}
----
`name`:: A unique name that you can use to refer to this `sslProfile`.

`certFile`:: The absolute path to the file containing the public certificate for this router.

`caCertFile`:: The absolute path to the CA certificate that was used to sign the router's certificate.

`privateKeyFile`:: The absolute path to the file containing the private key for this router's public certificate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the `qdrouterd` or root user can access the private key. For example:

----
chmod 0600 /etc/pki/tls/private/tls.key
chown qdrouterd /etc/pki/tls/private/tls.key
----

//`password`

. Configure the `connector` for this connection to use the `sslProfile` that you created.

    port: 5672

}
----
`sslProfile`:: The name of the `sslProfile` that defines the SSL/TLS private keys and certificates for the inter-router network.
