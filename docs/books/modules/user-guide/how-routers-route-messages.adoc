= How routers route messages

In a router network, _routing_ is the process by which messages are delivered to their destinations. To accomplish this, {RouterName} offers two different routing mechanisms:

Message routing::
Message routing enables you to distribute messages in anycast and multicast patterns. These patterns can be used for both direct routing, in which the router distributes messages between clients without a message broker, and indirect routing, in which the router enables clients to exchange messages through a message broker.
+
Message routing is useful for the following types of requirements:
+
--
* Default, basic message routing
+
{RouterName} automatically routes messages by default, so manual configuration is only required if you want routing behavior that is different than the default.

* Message-based routing patterns
+
Message routing supports both anycast and multicast routing patterns. You can load-balance individual messages across multiple consumers, and multicast (or fan-out) messages to multiple subscribers.

* Sharding messages across multiple message brokers when message delivery order is not important
+
Sharding messages from one producer might cause that producer’s messages to be received in a different order than the order in which they were sent.
--

Link routing::
Link routing enables you to establish a dedicated, virtual "path" between a sender and receiver that travels through the router network. Link routes are typically used to connect clients to message brokers in scenarios in which a direct connection is unfeasible. Therefore, link routes enable messaging capabilities that are not possible with message routing, such as:
+
--
* Transactional messaging
+
Link routing supports local transactions to a single broker. Distributed transactions are not supported.

* Guaranteed message delivery order
+
Link routing to a sharded queue preserves the delivery order of the producer’s messages by causing all messages on that link to go to the same broker instance.

* End-to-end flow control
+
Flow control is "real" in that credits flow across the link route from the receiver to the sender.

* Server-side selectors
+
With a link route, consumers can provide server-side selectors for broker subscriptions.
