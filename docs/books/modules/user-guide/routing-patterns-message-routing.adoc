= Routing patterns

Routing patterns define the paths that a message with a mobile address
can take across a network. These routing patterns can be used for both
direct routing, in which the router distributes messages between
clients without a broker, and indirect routing, in which the router
enables clients to exchange messages through a broker.

Routing patterns fall into two categories: Anycast
(Balanced and Closest) and Multicast. There is no concept of
"unicast" in which there is only one consumer for an address.

Anycast distribution delivers each message to one consumer whereas
multicast distribution delivers each message to all consumers.

Each address has one of the following routing patterns, which define the path that a message with the address can take across the messaging network:

Balanced:: An anycast method that allows multiple consumers to use the same address. Each message is delivered to a single consumer only, and {RouterName} attempts to balance the traffic load across the router network.
+
--
If multiple consumers are attached to the same address, each router determines which outbound path should receive a message by considering each path's current number of unsettled deliveries. This means that more messages will be delivered along paths where deliveries are settled at higher rates.

[NOTE]
====
{RouterName} neither measures nor uses message settlement time to determine which outbound path to use.
====

In this scenario, the messages are spread across both receivers regardless of path length:

--

Closest:: An anycast method in which every message is sent along the shortest path to reach the destination, even if there are other consumers for the same address.
+
{RouterName} determines the shortest path based on the topology cost to reach each of the consumers. If there are multiple consumers with the same lowest cost, messages will be spread evenly among those consumers.
+
In this scenario, all messages sent by `Sender` will be delivered to `Receiver 1`:

Multicast:: Messages are sent to all consumers attached to the address. Each consumer will receive one copy of the message.

In this scenario, all messages are sent to all receivers:
