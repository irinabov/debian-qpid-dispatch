= Link route example: Connecting clients and brokers on different networks

This example shows how a link route can connect a client to a message broker that is on a different private network.

.Router network with isolated clients
image::link-routing-02.png[Network isolation with link routing, align="center"]

The client is constrained by firewall policy to connect to the router in its own network (`R3`). However, it can use a link route to access queues, topics, and any other AMQP services that are provided on message brokers `B1` and `B2` -- even though they are on different networks.

In this example, the client needs to receive messages from `b2.event-queue`, which is hosted on broker `B2` in `Private Network 1`. A link route connects the client and broker even though neither of them is aware that there is a router network between them.

== Router configuration

To enable the client to receive messages from `b2.event-queue` on broker `B2`, router `R2` must be able to do the following:

* Connect to broker `B2`
* Route links to and from broker `B2`
* Advertise itself to the router network as a valid destination for links that have a `b2.event-queue` address

The relevant part of the configuration file for router `R2` shows the following:

--
[options="nowrap"]
----
connector {  // <1>
    name: broker
    role: route-container
    host: 192.0.2.1
    port: 61617
    saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
}

linkRoute {  // <2>
    prefix: b2
    direction: in
    connection: broker
}

linkRoute {  // <3>
    prefix: b2
    direction: out
    connection: broker
}
----
<1> The outgoing connection from the router to broker `B2`. The `route-container` role enables the router to connect to an external AMQP container (in this case, a broker).
<2> The incoming link route for receiving links from client senders. Any sender with a target whose address begins with `b2` will be routed to broker `B2` using the `broker` connector.
<3> The outgoing link route for sending links to client receivers. Any receivers whose source address begins with `b2` will be routed to broker `B2` using the `broker` connector.
--

This configuration enables router `R2` to advertise itself as a valid destination for targets and sources starting with `b2`. It also enables the router to connect to broker `B2`, and to route links to and from queues starting with the `b2` prefix.

[NOTE]
====
While not required, routers `R1` and `R3` should also have the same configuration.

== How the client receives messages

By using the configured link route, the client can receive messages from broker `B2` even though they are on different networks.

Router `R2` establishes a connection to broker `B2`. Once the connection is open, `R2` tells the other routers (`R1` and `R3`) that it is a valid destination for link routes to the `b2` prefix. This means that sender and receiver links attached to `R1` or `R3` will be routed along the shortest path to `R2`, which then routes them to broker `B2`.

To receive messages from the `b2.event-queue` on broker `B2`, the client attaches a receiver link with a source address of `b2.event-queue` to its local router, `R3`. Because the address matches the `b2` prefix, `R3` routes the link to `R1`, which is the next hop in the route to its destination. `R1` routes the link to `R2`, which routes it to broker `B2`. The client now has a receiver established, and it can begin receiving messages.

[NOTE]
====
If broker `B2` is unavailable for any reason, router `R2` will not advertise itself as a destination for `b2` addresses. In this case, routers `R1` and `R3` will reject link attaches that should be routed to broker `B2` with an error message indicating that there is no route available to the destination.
