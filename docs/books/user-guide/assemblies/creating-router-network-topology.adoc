= Creating a router network topology

You can deploy {RouterName} as a single standalone router, or as multiple routers connected together in a router network. Router networks may represent any arbitrary topology, enabling you to design the network to best fit your requirements.

With {RouterName}, the router network topology is independent from the message routing. This means that messaging clients always experience the same message routing behavior regardless of the underlying network topology. Even in a multi-site or hybrid cloud router network, the connected endpoints behave as if they were connected to a single, logical router.

To create the router network topology, complete the following:

. xref:planning-router-network-router[Plan the router network].
+
You should understand the different router operating modes you can deploy in your topology, and be aware of security requirements for the interior portion of the router network.

. xref:adding-routers-router-network-router[Build the router network by adding routers one at a time].
+
For each router, you must configure the following:

.. Router properties
.. Network connections (incoming and outgoing)
.. Security (authentication and authorization)
