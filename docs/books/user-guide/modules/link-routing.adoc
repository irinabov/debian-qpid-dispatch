= Link routing

Link routing enables you to establish a dedicated, virtual "path" between a sender and receiver that travels through the router network. Link routes are typically used to connect clients to message brokers in scenarios in which a direct connection is unfeasible. Therefore, link routes enable messaging capabilities that are not possible with message routing, such as:

* Transactional messaging
+
Link routing supports local transactions to a single broker. Distributed transactions are not supported.

* Guaranteed message delivery order
+
Link routing to a sharded queue preserves the delivery order of the producerâ€™s messages by causing all messages on that link to go to the same broker instance.

* End-to-end flow control
+
Flow control is "real" in that credits flow across the link route from the receiver to the sender.

* Server-side selectors
+
With a link route, consumers can provide server-side selectors for broker subscriptions.
