= Router network security considerations

In the router network, the interior routers should be secured with a strong authentication mechanism in which they identify themselves to each other. You should choose and plan this authentication mechanism before creating the router network.

[WARNING]
====
If the interior routers are not properly secured, unauthorized routers (or endpoints pretending to be routers) could join the router network, compromising its integrity and availability.
====

You can choose a security mechanism that best fits your requirements. However, you should consider the following recommendations:

* Create an X.509 Certificate Authority (CA) to oversee the interior portion of the router network.

* Generate an individual certificate for each interior router.
+
Each interior router can be configured to use the CA to authenticate connections from any other interior routers.
+
[NOTE]
====
Connections from edge routers and clients can use different levels of security, depending on your requirements.
====

By using these recommendations, a new interior router cannot join the network until the owner of the CA issues a new certificate for the new router. In addition, an intruder wishing to spoof an interior router cannot do so because it would not have a valid X.509 certificate issued by the networkâ€™s CA.
