= Listening for client connections

To enable a router to listen for and accept connections from AMQP clients, you configure a `listener`.

Once the connection is enabled on the router, clients can connect to it using the same methods they use to connect to a broker. From the client's perspective, the router connection and link establishment are identical to a broker connection and link establishment.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of configuring a `listener` to listen for connections from the client, you can configure a `connector` to initiate connections to the client. In this case, the router will use the `connector` to initiate the connection, but it will not create any links. Links are only created by the peer that accepts the connection.

----
`host`:: The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or hostname on which the router will listen.
`port`:: The port number or symbolic service name on which the router will listen.
`role`:: The role of the connection. Specify `normal` to indicate that this connection is used for message delivery for AMQP clients.
`failoverUrls` (optional):: A comma-separated list of backup URLs the client can use to reconnect if the established connection is lost. Each URL must use the following form:
+
`[(amqp|amqps|ws|wss)://](__HOST__|__IP ADDRESS__)[:port]`
