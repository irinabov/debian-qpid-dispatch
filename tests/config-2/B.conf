container {
    ##
    ## worker-threads - The number of threads that will be created to
    ## process message traffic and other application work (timers, non-amqp
    ## file descriptors, etc.)
    ##
    ## The number of threads should be related to the number of available
    ## processor cores.  To fully utilize a quad-core system, set the
    ## number of threads to 4.
